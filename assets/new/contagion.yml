  In an investigation of how to prevent the spread of contagious illnesses, we want to know whether wearing a face mask and washing hands frequently are effective.

Uname: flu season
Yname: contracting a contagious illness

U=1: it's flu season
U=0: it's not flu season

#Z=1_partial: during flu season
#Z=0_partial: not during flu season

Y=1: contracting a contagious illness
Y=0: not contracting a contagious illness

#Y=1_end: contracted a contagious illness
#Y=0_end: didn't contract a contagious illness

graph: confounding
queries: [ate]
roles: {treatment: X, outcome: Y, confounder: U}

scenarios:
    1:
        Xname: wearing a face mask

        X=1: wearing a face mask
        X=0: not wearing a face mask

        #X1=1_sentence: people that wear a face mask
        #X1=0_sentence: people that don't wear a face mask

        do(X=1): putting on a face mask
        do(X=0): not putting on a face mask

        commonsense:
            U: [0.2, 0.8]
            Y|X=0,U=0: [0.1, 0.4]
            Y|X=1,U=0: [0.05, 0.3]
            Y|X=0,U=1: [0.3, 0.7]
            Y|X=1,U=1: [0.2, 0.6]

    2:
        Xname: washing hands frequently

        X=1: people wash their hands frequently
        X=0: people don't wash their hands frequently

        #X2=1_ant: people that wash their hands frequently
        #X2=0_ant: people that don't wash their hands frequently
        #X2=1_ant_end: that wash their hands frequently
        #X2=0_ant_end: that don't wash their hands frequently

        do(X=1): washing hands frequently
        do(X=0): not washing hands frequently

        commonsense:
            U: [0.1, 0.9]
            Y|X=0,U=0: [0.1, 0.4]
            Y|X=1,U=0: [0.2, 0.7]
            Y|X=0,U=1: [0.3, 0.8]
            Y|X=1,U=1: [0.4, 0.9]
