    The city government is considering putting up a street sign at one of two intersections. They want to know whether which one will have the greatest effect on curbing the number of car accidents.

Uname: children playing in the street
#Uname: traffic level
Yname: car accidents

Xsubject: a street sign
Ysubject: car accidents
Usubject: children
#Usubject: traffic

Unode: children playing in the street
#Unode: traffic level
Xnode: presence of a street sign
Ynode: prevalence of car accidents


U=1: children playing in the street
U=0: no children playing in the street

U=1_verb: are playing in the street
U=0_verb: aren't playing in the street

#U=1: high traffic level
#U=0: low traffic level
#
#U=1_verb: is high
#U=0_verb: is low

#U=1_subject: high traffic
#U=0_subject: low traffic


Y=1: there is a car accident
Y=0: there is no car accident

Y=1_verb: occur
Y=0_verb: don't occur

Y=1_end: occur
Y=0_end: don't occur

#do(X=1):

graph: confounding
queries: [ate]
roles: {treatment: X, outcome: Y, confounder: U}

commonsense:
    U: [0.05, 0.20] # NOTE: this was for "children playing in the street"
    Y|X=0,U=0: [0.05, 0.15]
    Y|X=1,U=0: [0.10, 0.25]
    Y|X=0,U=1: [0.15, 0.40]
    Y|X=1,U=1: [0.20, 0.50]

scenarios:
    1:
        Xname: presence of a street sign at the intersection A

        X=1: there is a street sign at the intersection A
        X=0: there is no street sign at the intersection A

        do(X=1): putting up a street sign at the intersection A
        do(X=0): not putting up a street sign at the intersection A

        X=1_verb: is put up at intersection A
        X=0_verb: isn't put up at intersection A

    2:
        Xname: presence of a street sign at the intersection B

        X=1: there is a street sign at the intersection B
        X=0: there is no street sign at the intersection B

        do(X=1): putting up a street sign at the intersection B
        do(X=0): not putting up a street sign at the intersection B

        X=1_verb: is put up at intersection B
        X=0_verb: isn't put up at intersection B
